            <p>This is my rendition of a famous dish from Nick Tahous, a resuraunt from my hometown, called a Garbage Plate, founded in 1918 by Alex Tahou.
                It's a staple dish that consists of home fries, macaroni salad, topped with your choice of meats. 
                You can garnish this dish with mustard, chopped onions, ketchup and a signiture meat hot sauce.
